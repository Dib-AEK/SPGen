# SPGen: Speed Profile Generator
=====================================

Welcome to SPGen, a tool for generating speed profiles using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). This repository showcases how to use the deep learning model for generating instantaneous vehicle speed profiles on road networks.

## Overview
-----------

SPGen is a Python-based tool that utilizes a two-stage deep learning approach to generate vehicle speed profiles on road networks. The model is designed to take into account various factors that affect vehicle speed, such as road geometry and traffic conditions.

## Getting Started
---------------

To get started with SPGen, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in your favorite Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to generate your first speed profiles.


### Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from SPGen import SPGen

# Load the input data (trips, sequences of links, along with their attributes)
df = pd.read_csv('input_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
df = ... df

# Initiate the first speed value 
in_velocity = ...

# Generate speed profiles
profiles_generator = SPGen.SPGen()
speed_profiles = profiles_generator.generate_speed_profiles_from_pandas(df, in_velocity = in_velocity)

# Visualize the results
plot(speed_profiles)
```
