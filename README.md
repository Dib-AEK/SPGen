# SPGen: Speed Profiles Generator
Welcome to SPGen, a tool for generating speed profiles using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs).

## Overview
SPGen is a repository showcasing how to use the deep learning model for generating instantaneous vehicle speed profiles on road networks.

## Getting Started
The main.ipynb notebook serves as a comprehensive guide, providing an example of how to leverage SPGen to generate dynamic speed profiles.

## Remark
We've fine-tuned the hyperparameters to marespecting the average speed üèéÔ∏èüí® Well, as a result, this is only one of many versions of the model.

## Quick Start:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open main.ipynb in your favorite Jupyter environment.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to generate your first speed profiles.

For a deeper understanding of the model architecture, training process, and insights into its predictive prowess, check out our detailed paper:
